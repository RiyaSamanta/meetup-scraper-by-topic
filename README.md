# Meetup Scraper by Topic
A python script that leverages both web scraping and meetup's api to create a rich dataset on a particular topic. It outputs a csv file which you can further explore!

## Requirements
This script works on any topic listed here https://www.meetup.com/topics/ , when the user has gotten an API key here https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/ . Having the loaded packages installed is also required. 

## Why is this project useful? 
This is mostly a tool for fun exploration of different communities around the world. That said, it could be used in some more specific ways, such as identifying density of interest in particular topics in different areas for the purpose of targeting outreach recruitment (in comnbination with other signals). 

## You work at GitHub. Is this a GitHub sponsored project?
I do work at GitHub, and it’s awesome! While GitHub is supportive of me contributing to open source, this project is independent of my work there, and in no way reflects GitHub’s philosophy or projects on this topic. This is just something I find personally interesting and want to build with the community.
